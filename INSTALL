## CONFIGURATION OF SNOSTRIP

Copy the whole SNOSTRIP folder into a directory of your choice.
The configuration file, the snoStrip pipeline, all necessary packages, and additional
scripts are located in the folder snoStrip.

Please move into the snoStrip directory and start the configuration script by

./configure.sh

The configure.sh script will search for all necessary programs and additional scripts. 
Several snoStrip scripts will be adapted to find the path required modules and
the uploaded databases will be modified to incorporate the correct path information.

Once the configuration process is finished, the snoStrip pipeline should work properly.




Please have a look in the examples directory to see how the snoStrip pipeline is applied.
